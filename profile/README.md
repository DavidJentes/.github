# Hi, I'm David!

I use this organisation for professional and Student Convention projects. Any personal projects I make go on [@daviddgtnt](https://github.com/daviddgtnt).

Some projects I make on this organization are my Student Convention Website Design projects. I won fifth place at International Student Convention last year with my website design.

If you want to see what I'm working on for this year's Student Conventions, check out [my new Website Design](https://davidjentes.github.io/websitedesign2025)!
